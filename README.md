This is a FrontendMentor Javascript junior challenge. I'm having fun with those drop menu is javascript. Still having some hard time on how to use CSS animation in javascript, but I'm having progress. Though, I was trying to make the Sidebar slide off just like it slides in. I made the start Sidebar animation in CSS and the end animation in javascript. Is that the correct way? I'd love to get some feedback on that or anything else. Thanks!
